    <h1>Fruit Cake Recipe | Traditional Christmas Cake</h1>
<p>Festive and flavorful homemade Eggless Fruit Cake is bursting with cheerful holiday spices and delicious rum-soaked fruits and nuts. It’s a classic Christmas recipe that makes a light, crumbly, and perfectly moist Christmas Cake that you’ll love to enjoy and share all season. No eggs needed!</p>

<h1>How to Make Eggless Fruit Cake</h1>
<h1>Prep & Soak Dry Fruits In Rum</h1>
<p>1: In a large bowl combine the following nuts and dried fruits:</p>
<p>*¼ cup of golden raisins</p>
<p>*¼ cup black raisins (seedless)</p>
<p>*¼ cup cashews</p>
<p>*2 tablespoons of dried cherries</p>
<p>*8 apricots</p>
<p>*8 to 9 dates, small to medium-sized</p>
<p>Rinse them well and drain thoroughly.</p>

<p>2: Finely chop everything with a knife, or use a food processor to roughly chop.</p>
<p>3: Transfer the chopped dried fruits and nuts to a bowl.</p>

<p>4. Now add ¼ cup of tutti frutti and ¼ cup chopped candied orange peel.</p>
<p>You can skip these ingredients if you don’t have them. But candied orange peels, gives a lovely citrusy, bitter-sweet notes in the cake.</p>
<p>5: Pour in one cup of rum, wine, or apple juice. I have used rum.</p>
<p>6. Mix very well and let the dried fruits and nuts soak in the rum for at least 12 hours, or for 2 to 3 days. You can keep at room temperature for up to 3 days.</p>
<p>7. Here is what the mixture will look like after soaking for 3 days.</p>

<h1>Prepare Spice Mix</h1>
<p>8: The spice blend in this fruit cake smells and tastes just like the holidays.</p>
<p>9: Add the spices in a spice grinder or a small grinder jar.</p>
<p>10: Grind the spices to a fine powder, and set aside.</p>
<p>11. At this point you want to go ahead and prepare your Christmas cake pan. To do so grease a 7 to 8.5 inches round pan very well with a neutral oil.</p>
<p>Since this is a moist cake, you can also line the cake pan with butter paper or parchment paper.</p>
<p>Also preheat oven at 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 minutes to get perfectly hot.</p>
<h1>Sift Dry Ingredients</h1>
<p>12: To make the batter, combine 1.5 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour in a sieve over a large bowl.</p>
<p>13: Then add the ground spice powder and ½ teaspoon of baking powder.</p>
<p>14: Sift the ingredients together into the bowl.</p>

<h1>Make Fruit Cake Batter</h1>
<p>15: Next add the soaked dried fruits and nuts – including the leftover rum – to the sifted dry ingredients.</p>
<img src="projectimages/f6.jpg" alt="">
<p>16: Add 1.5 cups of demerara sugar. You can also use powdered sugar, brown sugar, raw sugar, palm or coconut sugar – whatever you prefer!</p>
<p>17: Then add 1 cup of oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</p>
<p>18: Gently mix together the ingredients until just combined, making sure to not over-mix.</p>
<p>19: Next, in the same bowl in which dried fruits and nuts were soaked, add 1 cup of soy milk.</p>
<p>Feel free to use dairy milk – or almond milk, cashew milk, lite coconut milk, to make an eggless fruitcake that’s also vegan-friendly.</p>
<p>20: Add 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar) to the milk.</p>
<p>21: Mix well. Do not worry if the milk curdles a bit.</p>
<p>22: Now sprinkle 1 teaspoon of baking soda all over the milk.</p>
<p>23: Stir gently. The mixture will rise a bit.</p>
<p>24: Pour this milk mixture into the fruit cake batter.</p>
<img src="projectimages/f7.webp" alt="">
<p>25: Working quickly, use a spatula to combine the mixtures together.</p>
<p>26: It should form a wet batter that is smooth except for the lumps of dried fruits and nuts.</p>
<p>27: Pour the eggless fruit cake batter into the greased pan.</p>
<p>28: Give the pan a gentle shake and tap to level out the batter, using a spatula if necessary to even the top of the cake.</p>
<p>29: As you do not want the batter to reach the very top of the pan, you might need a second pan, like I used here. This is like an extra mini cake for you to enjoy!</p>

<h1>Bake Traditional Christmas Cake</h1>
<p>30: Now bake the fruit cake in a preheated oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour, depending on oven size.</p>
<p>31: The eggless fruit cake will have a beautiful golden brown color. Test the doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center – it should come out clean.</p>
<p>Allow the cake pan to cool completely on a wired rack or stand before flipping the cake out onto a plate.
