        <h1>Paneer Biryani Recipe (Easy Dum Method)</h1>
        <p>Paneer Biryani is a traditional, dum-cooked vegetarian biryani made by layering yogurt-marinated paneer with par-cooked basmati rice, fried onions (birista), herbs, saffron milk and ghee. Mildly spiced and delicately flavored, it’s a hearty one-pot dish that pairs perfectly with raita. Though it takes time to prepare, the result is always worth it – flavorful, filling, and simply irresistible. Cook it on the stovetop or in the oven.</p>
<h1>How to make Paneer Biryani</h1>
<p>Soak Rice & Fry Onions</p>
<p>1. Rinse 1 cup basmati rice very well in running fresh water until the starch clears from the water.</p>
<p>The water should be clear and not cloudy or opaque. Soak the rice grains in water for 30 minutes.</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb3.webp" alt="">
<p>2. While the rice is soaking, prep the ingredients for the biryani. Thinly slice 2 medium onions. You will need about ¾ to 1 cup sliced onions.</p>
<p>Heat 4 tablespoons oil or ghee in a small frying pan and add the sliced onions.</p>
<p>3. Stir and begin to fry the onions on low heat until golden. Add 1 or 2 pinches of salt for quick browning of the onions. Stir often, for uniform browning.</p>

<p>4. In the picture below, the onions have begun to turn golden.</p>
<p>5. When the onions are golden and caramelized, remove with a slotted spoon. Place the fried onions on kitchen paper towel and keep aside.</p>
<p>These crispy golden fried onions are also known as birista.</p>
<p>Keep the oil or ghee in which we fried the onions aside. We will be using this oil or ghee while layering the biryani.</p>

<p>6. Warm ¼ cup milk on stovetop or in the microwave. Add 16 to 18 saffron strands to the milk. Stir and keep aside.</p>

<h1>Make Marinade</h1>
<p>7. Whisk ½ cup whole milk curd (yogurt) in a mixing bowl until smooth.</p>
<p>Do not use sour curd as it will make your biryani taste sour.</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb7.webp" alt="">
<p>8. Add the following and mix well:</p>
<p>*1 teaspoon ginger paste</p>
<p>*1 teaspoon garlic paste</p>
<p>*1 teaspoon chopped green chilies</p>
<p>*1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves </p>
<p>*½ tablespoon chopped mint leaves</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb8.webp" alt="">
<p>9.  Add in the following spices and mix again:</p>
<p>*¼ teaspoon of turmeric powder (ground turmeric)</p>
<p>*¼ teaspoon caraway seeds (known as shahi jeera in Hindi)</p>
<p>*¼ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper</p>
<p>*¼ teaspoon of garam masala powder (subtitute ½ teaspoon curry powder instead)</p>
<p>*½ teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander)</p>
<p>*1 teaspoon lemon juice </p>
<p>*1 teaspoon lemon juice </p>
<p>10. Add half of the fried onions and 200 to 250 grams cubed paneer.</p>
<p>11. Mix gently. Cover and keep the marinated paneer aside for 30 minutes at room temperature. If you plan to marinate for a longer time, keep the bowl covered in the refrigerator.</p>

<h1>Cook Basmati Rice</h1>
<p>12. In the picture below, you see the soaked and drained basmati rice after 30 minutes. Drain all the water from the rice very well and keep aside.</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb10.webp" alt="">
<p>13. Bring 4 cups water to a rolling boil in a pot.</p>
<p>14. Add the whole spices</p>
<p>15. Add 1 teaspoon salt.</p>
<p>16. Now, add the soaked rice.</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb11.webp" alt="">
<p>17. Do not stir and you will see the temperature drops a bit after adding rice. Do not cover the pan while cooking rice.</p>
<p>18. Keep the heat to high and cook the rice without lowering the heat.</p>
<p>19. Boil the rice grains till 75% or ¾th cooked. It should have a bite when you eat.</p>
<p>20. Drain the cooked rice in a colander. You can rinse the rice grains gently to remove starch, if any, and to stop the grains from cooking.</p>
<p>Cover with a lid and keep the cooked basmati rice aside.</p>
<p>21. This is the marinated paneer after 30 minutes.</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb12.webp" alt="">
<h1>Assemble & Layer</h1>
<p>22. Add the same oil in which we fried the onions to a thick-bottomed pan or pot. If cooking the biryani in an oven, add the oil to an oven-safe glass bowl or pan.</p>
<p>23. Add the marinated paneer and layer neatly.</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb13.webp" alt="">
<p>24. Make a rice layer now. Add all the rice.</p>
<p>I have just made 2 layers. If you want, you can make 4 layers each of the marinated paneer and cooked rice.</p>
<p>25. Add the remaining fried onions.</p>
<p>26. Now, add 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves and ½ tablespoon chopped mint leaves.</p>
<p>27. Drizzle the prepared saffron milk all over. Place the saffron strands as well on the rice.</p>
<p>28. Dot with 1 to 2 tablespoons ghee.</p>
<p>You can also add 1 tablespoon rose water or kewra water at this step.</p>

<h1>Make Paneer Biryani</h1>
<p>29. Cover with an aluminium foil or with a moist cotton kitchen napkin.</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb15.webp" alt="">
<p>30. Place the lid tightly on the pan and place it on a tawa or skillet.</p>
<p>31. For the first 5 minutes, dum cook the biryani on medium heat. Later, reduce the heat and cook on low heat for 12 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>You can cook the biryani in a preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes at 180 degrees C (350 degrees F).</p>
<p>32. Here’s the Paneer Biryani after being dum cooked for 20 minutes. Check the bottom with a spoon and there should be no liquids.</p>
<p>If you find the bottom of pan watery or with any gravy or liquid, dum cook for 5 to 10 minutes more.</p>
<img src="projectimages/pb1.webp" alt="">
<p>33. Serve Paneer Biryani hot or warm with plain curd (yogurt), raita of your choice, salad or your favorite salan or curry.

</p>
<h1>Serving & Storage Suggestions</h1>
<p>You can enjoy this lovely Paneer Biryani hot or warm with a raita like Onion Raita, Cucumber Raita or Boondi Raita. You can serve with sliced onion-lemon salad or Kachumber Salad too.</p>
<p>Pairing it with curries like Mirchi Ka Salan and Bagara Baingan also is awesome. Even a simple plain yogurt tastes nice with this biryani.</p>
