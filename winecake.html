<h1>How to make Wine Cake</h1>
<h1>Soak Nuts & Dry fruits In Wine</h1>
<p>1. First chop ½ cup seedless dates, ¼ cup almonds, ¼ cup cashews, 4 to 5 halved walnuts, 5 to 6 glazed red cherries and a few candied orange peels and candied ginger.</p>
<p>You will require 1 tablespoon each of the chopped candied orange peels and candied ginger.</p>

<p>2. In a bowl or jar, soak the chopped nuts and dry fruits in 1 cup red wine. Cover and keep this bowl or jar in a cool, dry place.</p>
<p>I kept the bowl out for 3 days, and then for the remaining days, I kept in the refrigerator. Every alternate day, shake the jar or stir the soaked ingredients in the bowl.</p>
<p>3. The soaked nuts and dry fruits on the 14th day.</p>

<h1>Make Wine Cake  </h1>
<p>4. Sieve 2 cups all-purpose flour (maida) with 1 pinch salt, ½ teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon baking powder.</p>
<p>Add ¼ teaspoon cinnamon powder, ¼ teaspoon grated nutmeg and 1 teaspoon instant coffee. Mix well.</p>
<p>Also remember to preheat your oven for 15 minutes at 200 degree C/390 degrees F.</p>
<p>5. Now, add the soaked nuts and dry fruits, ½ cup + 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar (or brown sugar) and 2 tablespoons curd (yogurt) dissolved in 1 tablespoon water.</p>
<p>6. Add ¾ cup oil, ½ cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or essence.</p>
<p>7. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.</p>

<p>8. Pour the prepared batter in a greased or butter paper lined cake pan. I used 2 cake pans of 3.5 x 7.5 inches width.</p>
<p>9. Bake the cake in a preheated oven for 200 degree C/390 degrees F for about 50 minutes to 1 hour. The time taken to bake will vary depending upon your oven.</p>

<p>10. Place the loaf pan/pans on a wired rack to cool. When the Wine Cake has cooled, remove it gently from the pan.</p>
<p>When the cake is completely cooled, wrap the cake in an aluminium foil or cling film and allow the cake to mature for 2 to 3 days (at room temperature or in the fridge) before serving. I served it after 3 days.</p>
